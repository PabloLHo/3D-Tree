# KD-Tree
Implementation of the Kd-tree in 3D and 2D and visualisation of the same so that the different levels generated after its development can be seen. Implementation in C++/OpenGL. Final proyect for the subject Geometric Algorithms

## Local installation

If desired, the code can be executed locally. To do so, just execute the following commands:

For a Windows operating system
```bash
gh repo clone PabloLH0/KD-Tree
cd KD-Tree/Ejecutable
ejecutable.bat
```

For a Linux operating system
```bash
gh repo clone PabloLH0/KD-Tree
cd KD-Tree/Ejecutable
ejecutable.sh
```

## User Guide
Controls (Keys)
* 8: Randomize 2D cloud
* 9: Randomize 3D cloud
* +: Step by step kd tree visualization
* C: Full kd tree visualization

Camera
* W: Move forward
* A: Move left

* Y: Camera orbit movement, Z-axis rotation
* B: Reset camera to a home position
* Scroll: Zoom

Menu
* Rendering: Allows us to determine the types of topoligies to be observed as well as to determine the background of the scene.
* Models: Allows us to activate and deactivate the visualisation of the models in the scene as well as to edit them.
* Camera: Allows us to switch between the cameras available in the scene.
* Light: Allows us to change the components of the light as well as its position.
* Screenshot: Allows us to take a screenshot of the scene.
* KDTREE: Allows us to randomise 2D and 3D point clouds as well as determine the number of points that make them up.
